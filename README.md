# Welcome to the OCF!

This repository houses [tracking issues for ongoing OCF
projects](https://github.com/ocf/projects/issues) that do not have a single
corresponding GitHub repository.

Many issues fit better under another repository! Please don't open issues here
if it makes sense to open them on another repository. Some of the most common
other repositories are:
- [ocf/puppet](https://github.com/ocf/puppet)
- [ocf/ocflib](https://github.com/ocf/ocflib)
- [ocf/ocfweb](https://github.com/ocf/ocfweb)
- [ocf/utils](https://github.com/ocf/utils)
- [ocf/ircbot](https://github.com/ocf/ircbot)
- [ocf/slackbridge](https://github.com/ocf/slackbridge)

Also, please don't open pull requests for this repository (unless you are
updating this file). All _code_ should go in another repository.
