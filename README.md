# OCF Projects

This repository houses [tracking issues for OCF projects](https://github.com/ocf/projects/projects/1).

Projects should be added as issues here if they are substantial enough to benefit from a design doc. See existing issues for examples of design docs.

Here is a recent and more extensive design doc example: [OCF Web Redesign](https://notes.ocf.berkeley.edu/8dQoTXm_St2tjEvlSnUFug#). The first goal of design docs are to clearly illustrate to others what the problem is, since they may not know the context behind why changes are necessary. The second goal is to direct people to how to get involved.

Smaller feature requests likely fit better under another repository. Some of the most common other repositories are:
- [ocf/puppet](https://github.com/ocf/puppet)
- [ocf/ocflib](https://github.com/ocf/ocflib)
- [ocf/ocfweb](https://github.com/ocf/ocfweb)
- [ocf/utils](https://github.com/ocf/utils)
- [ocf/ircbot](https://github.com/ocf/ircbot)
- [ocf/slackbridge](https://github.com/ocf/slackbridge)
