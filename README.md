# OCF Projects

This repository houses [tracking issues for larger OCF projects](https://github.com/ocf/projects/projects/1).

There is also an tracking board for [small starter tasks](https://github.com/orgs/ocf/projects/4) across various OCF repos, designed for new staff to easily begin contributing. You can see our [administrative tasks](https://github.com/ocf/bod/) as well if you have been added to the ocf GitHub org.

---------------

Technical projects should be added as issues here if they are substantial enough to benefit from a design doc. See existing issues for examples of design docs.

Smaller feature requests likely fit better under another repository. Some of the most common other repositories are:
- [ocf/puppet](https://github.com/ocf/puppet)
- [ocf/ocflib](https://github.com/ocf/ocflib)
- [ocf/ocfweb](https://github.com/ocf/ocfweb)
- [ocf/utils](https://github.com/ocf/utils)
- [ocf/ircbot](https://github.com/ocf/ircbot)
- [ocf/slackbridge](https://github.com/ocf/slackbridge)
