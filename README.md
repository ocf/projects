# OCF Projects

This repository houses [tracking issues for OCF projects](https://github.com/ocf/projects/projects/1).

Projects should be added as issues here if they are substantial enough to benefit from a design doc. See existing issues for examples of design docs.

Smaller feature requests likely fit better under another repository. Some of the most common other repositories are:
- [ocf/puppet](https://github.com/ocf/puppet)
- [ocf/ocflib](https://github.com/ocf/ocflib)
- [ocf/ocfweb](https://github.com/ocf/ocfweb)
- [ocf/utils](https://github.com/ocf/utils)
